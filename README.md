# S&F Scrapbook Helper
A simple tool to help you fill the scrapbook. It searches the entire Hall of Fame with up to 10 newly created background characters and displays the characters with the most not yet collected items. 
You can then either attack the players manually (which might cost a mushroom), or click the automate button to battle the best character as soon, as it is free. 
Both normal and SSO (S&F Account) characters are supported.
If you have multiple accounts, or want to pause the progress, you can also store the crawling progress to disk.

I only wrote this tool, because I needed to quickly get characters a full scrapbook to test the api parsing of that. As such, I put no effort into the UI, or the code quality. 
If you have any issues, let me know. Currently I do not expect anyone to actually use this.
